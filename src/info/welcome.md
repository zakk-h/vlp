The menu in the top right corner <img src="https://zakklab.valdese.info/files/layers.png" width=24px title="Layer Button"> will open a menu that allows you to change what trails you can see on the map, toggle different markers on and off, as well as changing the map view (between Terrain Lines, A satellite view, and the Future Park Plan)

The icons you see on the map are clickable and will tell you about that location.

The <img src="https://zakklab.valdese.info/files/i.png" width=26px title="(i) button"> icon in the top left corner provides more information about the park along with summaries and pictures of all the trails here.
