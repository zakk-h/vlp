## Introduction to the App

Here are some of the features available in this app:

- You can track your location in the app by tapping the hiking man icon {{ icon.walk }}
in the app and your location will be shown on screen.

- The menu in the top right corner {{ icon.layers }} will open a menu that allows you to
change what trails you can see on the map, toggle different markers on and off, as well as changing
the map overlay image.

- The icons you see on the map are clickable and will tell you about that location.

- The info button icon in the top left corner provides more information about the park
along with summaries and pictures of all the trails here.
