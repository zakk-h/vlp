# About the Park

Welcome to **Valdese Lakeside Park**, a 300 acre park with construction set
to start in 2020. The park is maintained by the [Friends of the Valdese Rec][link-fvr]
volunteer organization.

The [Friends of the Valdese Rec][link-fvr] is [currently accepting donations][link-bridgedonate] for construction
of a **150 foot suspension bridge** connecting McGalliard Falls and Valdese Lakeside Park. Donations are accepted
through Facebook, Paypal, Mail, or a Stock donation.

**Planning to go out on the water?** Duke Energy manages the water level and [publishes
information about this][link-lakelevels]. We recommend putting in at the Table Rock
Viewing Site less than 0.1 miles down the Greenway.

**Want to see all the wildlife found at the park?** The park is home to a variety of
species. A generous sampling of the park wildlife can be seen on [the zakklab site][link-zakklab].
